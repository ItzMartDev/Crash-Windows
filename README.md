# üíª app.exe ‚Äì The Freeze Machine

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** This app will cause your computer to freeze instantly. Use only for educational or experimental purposes. Do **not** run it on a machine you care about.

## About

`app.exe` is a Windows executable created to simulate a critical system overload scenario. As soon as it's launched, it aggressively consumes all available CPU and RAM resources, causing the system to lock up before any user interface appears.

This program is intended as a humorous example of bad design, or as a learning tool to understand the risks of uncontrolled resource usage in software.

## What It Does

- Attempts to max out CPU and memory the moment it's opened  
- Causes the system to freeze or crash almost immediately  
- Leaves no time for Task Manager or escape  

## Installation

You can get `app.exe` in two ways:

### üîó Option 1: Download Directly

Grab the executable here:  
**[Download app.exe](https://github.com/ItzMartDev/Crash-Windows/raw/refs/heads/main/app.exe)**

Just click the link and save the file to your computer. Double-click to unleash chaos. (Not recommended unless you know what you're doing.)

### üõ†Ô∏è Option 2: Manual Build

1. Clone this repository:

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/ItzMartDev/Crash-Windows.git</code></pre>

2. Navigate into the folder and open the source code (if available).
3. Compile the code using your preferred compiler for Windows.

## Why?

Because sometimes you need to see the chaos to appreciate the calm.  
And because "How bad could it be?" is always a fun last sentence.
