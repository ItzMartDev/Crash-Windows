# app.exe – The Freeze Machine

> ⚠️ **Warning:** This app will cause your computer to freeze instantly. Use only for educational or experimental purposes. Do **not** run it on a machine you care about.

## About

`app.exe` is a Windows executable created to simulate a critical system overload scenario. As soon as it's launched, it aggressively consumes all available CPU and RAM resources, causing the system to lock up before any user interface appears.

This program is intended as a humorous example of bad design, or as a learning tool to understand the risks of uncontrolled resource usage in software.

## What It Does

- Attempts to max out CPU and memory the moment it's opened
- Causes the system to freeze or crash almost immediately
- Leaves no time for Task Manager or escape

## Why?

Because sometimes you need to see the chaos to appreciate the calm.  
And because "How bad could it be?" is always a fun last sentence.
